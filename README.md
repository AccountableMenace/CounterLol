# Counter
This is a project I worked on to develop my programming skills, especially on the front-end side, as this was my first experience coding using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 
The project is ultimately a webpage that allows one to track several counts/scores. Each counter can be named and incremented/decremented accordingly. There are also sorting options for the counters.
